DHA is a vital nutrient in the early stages of life, and its inclusion in infant formula ensures that infants receive the essential omega-3 fatty acids needed for optimal growth and development. The rise in demand for plant-based, vegan, and sustainable products has prompted infant formula manufacturers to seek plant-derived sources of DHA, with algae oil being the preferred choice.
